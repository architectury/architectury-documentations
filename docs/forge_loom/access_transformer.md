Access Transformers must be created in `META-INF/accesstransformer.cfg`, in MCP and SRG mappings. (Basically keep your ATs from Forge, don't remap them)

You may also refer to the [Forge Documentation](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/accesstransformers/) on this topic if you are new to this.
